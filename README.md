# JScookiesLawPopUp

This is JS pop out to show a the terms and conditions and privacy statments.

There are plenty of similar pop up in the net but I wish to create one easy to pick even from beginners whom are just starting with web developmen. 

The first realease will be based on a blue print with imperative programming and will gradually evolve in a single function. 

I haven't decided yet if the message and settings will be stored in a jason file or an object.
